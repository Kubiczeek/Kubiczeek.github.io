      Buse BS100 is popular czech manufactured IBIS system. It was created by the BUSE company and it had been working firstly with the destination panels called "flipdots". Later they updated it to make the new version with "LEDs". Our version is identical to the newer version with "LEDs". When you buy this, you get the destination boards and the BUSE.
